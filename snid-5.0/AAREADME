		    SNID installation instructions

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SNID is written in Fortran 77 and so requires an appropriate compiler
(g77, gfortran, etc.). The interactive plotting package is based on
PGPLOT, so make sure you have the corresponding libraries installed.

If you have complaints/suggestions on compiler options etc. please
contact me: sblondin@cfa.harvard.edu

======================================================================


0. Unpack the tarball snid-5.0.tar.gz in the directory of your choice
(hereby referred to as INSTALL_DIR):

	cp snid-5.0.tar.gz INSTALL_DIR
	cd INSTALL_DIR
	gunzip snid-5.0.tar.gz
	tar -xvf snid-5.0.tar

This will create a directory named snid-5.0/ . You can then safely
remove the snid-5.0.tar.gz file.

The snid-5.0/ directory contains the following subdirectories:

bin		contains the snid, logwave, and plotlnw executables
button		contains the button library used with PGPLOT
doc		contains various documentation
examples	contains example text and graphical output
source		contains most of the fortran source code (*.f)
templates	contains the spectral templates (*.lnw)
test		contains files for test runs
utils		contains further fortran source code (*.f)

It also contains installation instructions (AAREADME), the
Makefile, and a copy of the GNU General Public License (gpl-3.0.txt).



1. cd to the snid-5.0/ directory. Open the file snidmore.f in the
source/ subdirectory with your favourite editor, and set the tempdir
variable (in the gettempdir subroutine, line 52 in snidmore.f) to
point to the directory containing the spectral templates:

      tempdir='INSTALL_DIR/snid-5.0/templates/'

NOTE: Make sure you comply with the 72 character line limit! (Read the
"IMPORTANT!" note in snidmore.f)



2. Now you need to edit the Makefile. Open this file up with your
favourite editor and uncomment the FC, FFLAGS, XLIBS, and PGLIBS
variables corresponding to your operating system (Linux, Solaris, Mac
PowerPC, or Mac Intel). For example, on a Linux PC:

# ------
# Linux
# ------
FC= g77
FFLAGS= -O
XLIBS= -L/usr/X11R6/lib/ -lX11 
PGLIBS= -L/usr/local/pgplot -lpgplot

NOTE: the X11 and PGPLOT libraries may not be located at
/usr/X11R6/lib/ and /usr/local/pgplot/, respectively. If this is the
case, edit the XLIBS and PGLIBS settings accordingly.

NOTE: If you use a compiler different than the one specified for your
OS (g77 for Linux; Sun f77/f90 for Solaris; g77 for Mac PPC; gfortran
for Mac Intel), consult the table below to set the appropriate FFLAGS
compiler flags:

Compiler	OS			FFLAGS 
-------------------------------------------------------
g77		Linux			-O -fno-automatic
gfortran	Linux			-O -fno-automatic
Intel 		Linux			-O -save
Sun 		Solaris			-O
IBM 		IBM AIX, Linux, etc.	-O -qsave
SGI 		SGI IRIX		-O -static
Compaq 		Tru64 Unix		-O -static

FOR MAC USERS: Linking the pgplot libraries on a Mac requires to also
link the png, z, and aquaterm libraries: 

	PGLIBS= (...) -L/sw/lib -lpng -lz -laquaterm (...)

If the libpng.*, libz.* and libaquaterm.* are not in /sw/lib, you
will need to edit the PGLIBS setting accordingly.


3. Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PGPLOT_DIR environment variables to
point to the PGPLOT installation directory (see the note in the
Makefile): 

[in (t)csh]
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgplot
      setenv PGPLOT_DIR /usr/local/pgplot

[in bash]
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/pgplot"
      export PGPLOT_DIR="/usr/local/pgplot"



4. Now you're ready to compile SNID! Make sure you're in the snid-5.0/
directory (which contains the Makefile) then simply type:

	make

If this doesn't produce any error messages (note that you may get a
few "Warnings" depending on which compiler you use, but those are
harmless) then type:

	make install

which will simply copy the executable files (snid, logwave, and
plotlnw) to the bin/ directory. Remember to add this bin/ directory to
your $PATH environment variable if you want to be able to execute SNID
from any directory on your system:

      setenv PATH $PATH:INSTALL_DIR/snid-5.0/bin     [for (t)csh]
      export PATH=$PATH:INSTALL_DIR/snid-5.0/bin     [for bash]

~~~~
NOTE: If you do get error messages after typing "make" then make sure
you clean up before attempting to recompile. This is done by typing:

	make realclean ; make

If the compilation then succeeds you can type 'make install' to copy
the executable files to the bin/ directory.

5. For info on how to use SNID, look at the Howto.snid file in the
doc/ subdirectory. In the meantime, you can do a trial run on the
spectrum of sn2003jo.dat in the test/ subdirectory [follow the
'1.3. Example run' section in Howto.snid]:

	cd test/
	snid sn2003jo.dat

...and follow the prompts. Have fun!
